BIOMI 6300 Amplicon sequencing project on Pomacanthus sexstriatus GI samples

P. sexstriatus is also known as the six-bar angelfish. It lives in tropical coral reefs in the south pacific and feeds on algae and marine invertebrates.

In the Angert lab, we have been studying P. sexstriatus for 20 years. Using pyrosequencing and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) we have confirmed the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogens in the hindgut of its intestinal tract. 

Now, we have generated illumina sequencing by synthesis data. This project is where we will process that data. 

We have 12 samples (24 forward and reverse reads). Each forward or reverse read has a fastq.gzip. These files range from 4 MB to 7 MB.  These samples are of section IV and section V of the intestinal tract. Section V has also been referred to as the hindgut. 

I also have 2 control samples, each with forward and reverse reads. This brings the total number of fastq files to 28.

For this project, I have organized my work into data, figures, analysis, and abridged folders. Data contains input and generated data. Figures contains generated figures. Analysis contains R markdown and rendered HTML documents of code. Abridged contains abridged version of files in the analysis folder. I am sending these to my committee as references.
